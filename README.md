# Dental_Analytics

Dental Hospital Analytics Project

This project analyzes the operational and financial performance of a dental clinic by examining key metrics such as patient flow, revenue, expenses, and treatment success rates. The goal is to identify areas for improvement and optimize clinic operations to enhance patient experience and profitability. The project uses data visualization techniques to present insights and trends in a clear and accessible way. The dataset used for this project is the clinic's internal records of patient visits, treatments, and financial transactions.

### Background

Dental hospitals and clinics collect vast amounts of data on their patients, including demographics and appointment history. Analyzing this data can provide insights into patient behavior and preferences, allowing hospitals to improve their services and optimize their operations.

This project aims to explore and visualize the data from a dental hospital to gain insights into customer demographics and appointments.

### Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. You can install these libraries using pip:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage

To use this project, simply run the Jupyter notebook dental-analytics.ipynb. This notebook contains all the code for loading and analyzing the data, as well as generating visualizations.

### Data

The data for this project is stored in the file dental-hospital-data.csv. This file contains information on patient demographics and appointments, including the following fields:

- PACT_ID: Patient appointment identification number.
- HOSPITAL_LEVEL: The level of the hospital.
- VISITED_ER_BEFORE_ONE_DAY: Whether the patient visited the emergency room one day before the appointment or not.
- MRN: Medical Record Number.
- AGE: Age of the patient.
- YEAR_FILE_CREATION: Year in which the file is created.
- PATIENT_FILE_CREATION_DATE: Date when the patient's file is created.
- GENDER: Gender of the patient.
- APPOINTMENT_DTM: Appointment date and time.
- APPOINTMENT_DATE: Date of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_DAY: Day of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_MONTH: Month of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_DAY_NAME: Day name of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_MONTH_NAME: Month name of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_YEAR: Year of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_TIME: Time of the appointment.
- APPOINTMENT_TIME_AMPM: Time of the appointment in AM/PM format.
- CHECK_IN_YN: Whether the patient checked-in for the appointment or not.
- CHECK_IN_DTM: Date and time of patient check-in.
- CANCEL_YN: Whether the appointment was canceled or not.
- CANCEL_DTM: Date and time when the appointment was canceled. - and many more...

### Methodology

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into the data. The notebook dental-analytics.ipynb contains code for loading and cleaning the data, as well as generating various visualizations.

The EDA process includes the following steps:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization

### Results

The results of this project include various visualizations and insights into the customer demographics and appointment patterns of the dental hospital. Some of the key findings include:
 
- The majority of patients have a no-show count of 1-7, and there are more patients who show up for appointments than those who don't.
- There are more teenage patients than adult and elderly patients.
- There are more female patients than male patients, and more female patients cancel their appointments than male patients.
- Patients who are enrolled from 2000-2019 have the highest number of enrollments, and patients enrolled in 1988 and 2006 have the highest number of no-shows.
- Patients in the age range of 28-40 years are the ones who don't show up for their appointments the most.
- Patients with hypertension have a lower previous show count than patients without hypertension.
- Patients who book through the reception call center are more likely to cancel their appointments than patients who book through other modes.
- Patients with Primary Free eligibility are more likely to book their appointments in the morning.

### Recommendations:

- Encourage patients to attend their appointments by sending appointment reminders and emphasizing the importance of regular check-ups.
- Consider offering incentives for patients who show up to their appointments, such as discounts or other rewards.
- Provide more education on hypertension and the importance of managing it, particularly for female patients who have hypertension and a lower previous show count.
- Evaluate the booking process through the reception call center to identify ways to reduce cancellations and no-shows.
- Provide more information and education to patients with RC eligibility type to encourage them to attend their appointments.
- Consider offering more morning appointment slots for patients with Primary Free eligibility to encourage them to book appointments.
