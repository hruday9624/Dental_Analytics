# Dental_Analytics

Dental Hospital Analytics Project

This project analyzes the operational and financial performance of a dental clinic by examining key metrics such as patient flow, revenue, expenses, and treatment success rates. The goal is to identify areas for improvement and optimize clinic operations to enhance patient experience and profitability. The project uses data visualization techniques to present insights and trends in a clear and accessible way. The dataset used for this project is the clinic's internal records of patient visits, treatments, and financial transactions.

### Background

Dental hospitals and clinics collect vast amounts of data on their patients, including demographics and appointment history. Analyzing this data can provide insights into patient behavior and preferences, allowing hospitals to improve their services and optimize their operations.

This project aims to explore and visualize the data from a dental hospital to gain insights into customer demographics and appointments.

### Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. You can install these libraries using pip:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage

To use this project, simply run the Jupyter notebook dental-analytics.ipynb. This notebook contains all the code for loading and analyzing the data, as well as generating visualizations.

### Data

The data for this project is stored in the file dental-hospital-data.csv. This file contains information on patient demographics and appointments, including the following fields:

patient_id: Unique identifier for the patient
age: Age of the patient
gender: Gender of the patient
appointment_date: Date of the appointment
appointment_time: Time of the appointment
appointment_duration: Duration of the appointment in minutes
treatment: Type of treatment received by the patient
fee: Fee charged for the treatment

### Methodology

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into the data. The notebook dental-analytics.ipynb contains code for loading and cleaning the data, as well as generating various visualizations.

The EDA process includes the following steps:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization

### Results

The results of this project include various visualizations and insights into the customer demographics and appointment patterns of the dental hospital. Some of the key findings include:

The majority of patients are between the ages of 20 and 40
There is a slightly higher proportion of female patients than male patients
The most common type of treatment is a routine checkup
The highest fee charged for a treatment is $500
There is a peak in appointment volume in October
