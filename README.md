### Background

Dental hospitals and clinics collect vast amounts of data on their patients, including demographics and appointment history. Analyzing this data can provide insights into patient behavior and preferences, allowing hospitals to improve their services and optimize their operations.

This project aims to explore and visualize the data from a dental hospital to gain insights into customer demographics and appointments.

### Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. You can install these libraries using pip:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Once you've installed the necessary libraries, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```python
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/dental-analytics-project.git](https://github.com/yourusername/dental-analytics-project.git)
```

### Usage

To use this project, simply run the Jupyter notebook dental-analytics.ipynb. This notebook contains all the code for loading and analyzing the data, as well as generating visualizations.

### Data
